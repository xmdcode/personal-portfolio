        dscr: 'I began my career as an IT Administrator with the Hellenic Army in Cyprus, where I managed IT operations for several months. Following this, I transitioned to sales at Plaisio in Patras, gaining valuable customer-facing experience. My technical journey advanced significantly when I joined Globalexpress.gr as a Shopify Web Developer and E-commerce Manager. There, I developed and maintained multiple e-shops, managed digital marketing campaigns, and created custom web applications. At Quality and Reliability SA, I worked on transferring layouts to Tailwind CSS and testing their integration with existing libraries. My most recent role at Andko Digital involved creating front-ends for e-shops using Next.js and CSS frameworks, developing static HTML from Figma designs, and customizing CMS parameters to align with client needs. My collaborative work in agile teams across these roles has further honed my ability to deliver high-quality web solutions efficiently.',
